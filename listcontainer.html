                            <li>* DELIVERY AND RETURN SERVICES - Dragon is the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and currently the only cargo spacecraft flying capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth.</li> 
                            <li>*Dragon accommodates pressurized cargo in the capsule as well as unpressurized cargo in its trunk.</li>
                            <li>* VERSATILE CARGO RACKS - The racks are a honeycomb carbon-aluminum construction designed for efficient packing in a zero-gravity environment. </li>
                            <li>They accommodate a variety of standard-size NASA cargo bags as well as freezers for carrying materials such as biological samples.</li>
